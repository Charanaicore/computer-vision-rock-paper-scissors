# Computer Vision RPS
Created a GitHub repo.
Created four models Rock,Paper,scissors and Nothing in Teachable-Machine. 
Each class Class is trained with the images of myself that showing with each option to the camera.
Downloaded the model from Tensorflow tab in Teachable-Machine,and named keras_model.h5 amd the text file containing the lables is named as lables.txt.
The files i downloaded contain the structure and the parameters of a deep learning model,and they are not the files that can be run.
They do not contain anything that can be readable.
Pushed the models and lables to my GitHub repository. 
Created and activated conda environment and installed necessary requirements.
Installed pip by running conda install pip and installed libraries by running pip install.
Installed ipykernel by running pip install ipykernel in the terminal.
After installing , created a requriements.txt file by running pip list > reqirements.txt.
Checked the model thet i downloaded is working as expected.
Created a file called manual_rps.py which is used to play the game without camara.
Used a random module to pick the random option between given "Rock","Paper","Scissors".
Figured who won ,by using if,elif,else statements.

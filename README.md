# Computer Vision RPS
Created a GitHub repo.
Created four models Rock,Paper,scissors and Nothing in Teachable-Machine. 
Each class Class is trained with the images of myself that showing with each option to the camera.
Downloaded the model from Tensorflow tab in Teachable-Machine,and named keras_model.h5 amd the text file containing the lables is named as lables.txt.
The files i downloaded contain the structure and the parameters of a deep learning model,and they are not the files that can be run.
They do not contain anything that can be readable.
Pushed the models and lables to my GitHub repository.
